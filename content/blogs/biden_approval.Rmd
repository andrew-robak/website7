# Biden's Approval Margins

We will analyse the evolution of approval margins of US
President Joe Biden. Glimpsing at the dataset, we notice there are 22
variables and 4,495 observations:

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Import approval polls data directly off fivethirtyeight website
approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 

glimpse(approval_polllist)
```

## Create a plot

We will first calculate the net approval rate (approve - disapprove) for
each week in 2022 along with its 95% confidence interval, and then plot
the results as a line plot grouping by respodent group (Adults, Voters,
All Groups).

```{r question2}

fixed_dates <- approval_polllist %>%
  mutate(date = mdy(enddate),
         weeks = week(date),
         year = year(date),
         net_rate = approve - disapprove) %>%
  filter(year == 2022, weeks<50) %>%
  group_by(subgroup , weeks) %>%
  
  # we calculated the 95% confidence interval. 
  summarise(mean_rate = mean(net_rate,na.rm=TRUE),
            sd_rate = sd(net_rate,na.rm=TRUE),
            number = n(),
            t_critical = qt(0.975,number-1),
            lower_bound = mean_rate - t_critical*sd_rate/ sqrt(number),
            upper_bound = mean_rate + t_critical*sd_rate/ sqrt(number)) 

# we draw the graph of the net approval rate changing over weeks with its confidence interval.
  ggplot(fixed_dates, aes(x = weeks, y = mean_rate, color = subgroup)) + 
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lower_bound, ymax = upper_bound), 
              fill = "orange", 
              alpha = 0.25, 
              show.legend = FALSE) +
    facet_grid(rows = vars(subgroup)) +
    geom_line(aes(x = weeks, y = mean_rate, 
                  color = subgroup),
              show.legend = FALSE) +
    labs(title = "Biden's net approval ratings in 2022",
         subtitle = "Weekly Data, Approve - Disapprove, %",
         caption = "Source: https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-data/",
         x = NULL, 
         y = NULL) +
    theme_minimal()


```

We can see President Biden's net approval relative has remained negative
since the first week of 2022 among all poll respondents, meaning more
people disapprove than approve of the President. Furthermore, we notice
a sharp decline in the net approval rate beginning in week 23. Since
that time, the approval rate seems to have returned to pre-drop levels,
potentially due to the POTUS's recent delivery on several campaign
promises, primarily passing the Inflation Reduction Act.
