<p>First, we calculate the monthly change in Tfl bike rentals, calculated
as the difference between the actual monthly average and the historical
average calculated between 2016-2019. We plot the data faceting by year,
using <code>geom_ribbon()</code> to visualize the positive/negative deltas.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#calculating expected number of rentals
compare &lt;- bike %&gt;%
  filter(year %in% c(2016:2019)) %&gt;%

  summarise(compare_avg = mean(bikes_hired))

<p>We can see that Tfl bike rentals have been lower than in the 2016-2019
at the beginning of the pandemic, but quickly recovered and exceeded
historical data. Interestingly, there has been a significant uptake
starting in the second half of 2021, possibly due to changing
preferences regarding means of transport, with public transport losing
users to Tfl bikes.</p>
<p>Next, we plot a similar graph to visualize weekly changes in Tfl bike
rentals between actual data and the 2016-2019 average.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#calculating expected number of rentals

  filter(year %in% 2017:2022) %&gt;%

<p>Again, one can easily notice the drops at the beginning of 2020 (start
of the pandemic) and in winter of 2021 (COVID wave), as well as the
sizable increase in Tfl rentals since the second half of 2021.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the mean has been used to calculate the expected
number of bike rentals for each month/week since the data follows a
normal distribution, as seen in the histogram below. Otherwise, it would
have been optimal to use the median instead, as it is a more robust
measure of central tendency.</p>
